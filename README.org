As we're all aware, one of the lovely things about working in plaintext is that
you can run version control over your documents. =git diff= does a perfectly
passable job at showing you how your Org files has changed, but what about when
you want something richer? Well =latexdiff= is brilliant for LaTeX files, and you
can export Org to LaTeX! However, it's a bit of a hassle, you need to
1. Check out an old revision of your repository
2. Export your Org file to LaTeX
3. Fast-forward to the newer version
4. Do /another/ Org export to LaTeX
5. Run =latexdiff= on the two =.tex= files
6. Compile to a PDF, and view it

Gah! This is sounding like a bit of a pain. That's where *OrgDiff* comes in. It
automates all of the above, and provides a few other quality of life
improvements, namely:
+ Commit selection via the venerable Magit
+ Parallel exporting of the two Org files to TeX
+ Descriptive forms of the main =latexdiff= options, accessible via a Transient interface
+ Automatic TeX compiler-upgrading. I.e., if one document needs LuaLaTeX and the
  other needs XeLaTeX, then we need to use LuaLaTeX to compile the =latexdiff= result

Along with that we provide some more basic options, like comparing any two Org
files without git, just creating the =.tex= diff, or running ~ediff~ on the Org
files.

Do note that while this seems to work, it's quite early on in development, and
it shows in the code (lack of documentation, etc.). It seems perfectly usable
though ðŸ™‚.
